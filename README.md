# week-4-game


1. Set Vars
Target Score = random number chosen that you must reach
Total Score = score you get from clicking crystals
wins = number of times you win
loses = number of times you lose
crystal1
crystal2
crystal3
crystal4

2. Functions
Target score = Math.floor(Math.random()*120+19 )
Total Score = c1+c2+c3+c4 (Might be a function)
Wins =function (Total Score = Target Score) (wins++)
Lose = function (Total Score > Target Score) (lose--)
crystal1-crystal4 = Math.floor(Math.random()*12+1 )
reset function () (generates a new target score, total score equals 0, crystals new random number)

Gameplay Pseudocode:

1. A random value is set for the targetScore, a number between 50 - 100
2. Random values between 10-30 are set for each crystal
